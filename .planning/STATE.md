# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-09)

**Core value:** No project dies without a documented decision, and every thought trail is fully reconstructable.
**Current focus:** v1.1 i18n Quality — fix umlauts and complete i18n coverage

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1 i18n Quality

Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-02-09 — Milestone v1.1 started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- npm strict-ssl disabled in dev environment due to SSL cert issue (development-only concern)
- gh CLI now available (installed via brew)

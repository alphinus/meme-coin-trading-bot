## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases derived from 53 v1 requirements at comprehensive depth
- [Roadmap]: Real-time collaboration infrastructure built into Phase 1 foundation (event store + event bus)
- [Roadmap]: NOTF-01 grouped with Telegram (Phase 7) since notifications span web + Telegram + email channels
- [Roadmap]: SRCH-01 grouped with Integrations (Phase 8) since AI search requires all data flowing before it adds value

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags Phase 4 (AI), Phase 6 (Voice), Phase 7 (Telegram), Phase 8 (Integrations) as needing deeper research during planning
- Research suggests starting with simplified 3-4 GSD phases instead of full 8 -- user decision needed during Phase 5 planning

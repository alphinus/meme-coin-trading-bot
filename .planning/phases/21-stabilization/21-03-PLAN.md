<objective>
Fix all test failures identified in Plan 21-02's verification results, scan the 3 main UX surfaces for additional rough edges, then have the human re-verify that the fixes work.

Purpose: STAB-02 requires all failures from the verification pass to be fixed. STAB-03/04/05 require identifying and polishing UX rough edges in wizards, mode toggle, and navigation/palette -- not just fixing what tests caught. This is a fix-scan-verify cycle: the agent analyzes each failure, scans for additional UX issues, implements fixes, and the human confirms.

Output: All previously failing tests now pass. UX rough edges identified and fixed (or documented). Updated verification results document.

NOTE: This plan's `files_modified` is empty because the specific files depend on which tests failed. The agent will modify whatever files are needed based on the failure reports from 21-02. If all tests passed in 21-02, this plan completes immediately with no changes needed.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Analyze failures and implement fixes</name>
  <files>Determined by failure reports from 21-02</files>
  <action>
**If all tests passed in 21-02:** Create 21-03-SUMMARY.md noting "All 31 tests passed -- no remediation needed" and complete immediately.

**If failures exist:**

1. Read `.planning/phases/21-stabilization/21-VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md` to get the failure list
2. For each failure:
   a. Identify the root cause by reading the relevant source files
   b. Determine the minimal fix (do NOT refactor or add features -- just fix the failing behavior)
   c. Implement the fix
   d. Run TypeScript compilation to verify no errors introduced: `cd /Users/developer/eluma && npx tsc --noEmit -p client/tsconfig.json`

**Common failure patterns and fix approaches (from research):**

- **Wizard transition bug:** Check WizardShell.tsx goNext/goBack callbacks, wizardData propagation, step component key prop
- **Mode toggle not updating UI:** Check useMode hook's setMode, verify localStorage key `eluma-mode`, check ModeToggle component state
- **Command palette not opening:** Check GsdCommandPalette.tsx keyboard event listener (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K), verify isExpert guard
- **Route guard not redirecting:** Check ExpertRoute component, verify it reads from useMode and redirects to /home
- **Agent session not starting:** Check CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN validity, session-manager.ts, check for auth-check errors in server logs
- **i18n key showing instead of text:** Missing key in en.json/de.json -- add the key to both locale files
- **CollapsibleSection not expanding:** Check CollapsibleSection.tsx isOpen state, default expansion logic based on mode

**Scope boundaries:**
- Do NOT fix the 17 pre-existing server TypeScript errors (Google Calendar, Gmail, Telegram menus, notification emitter)
- Do NOT add new features
- Do NOT refactor working code
- Only fix what the tests revealed as broken

3. After all fixes are implemented, update 21-VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md to note which failures were addressed and what was changed

**4. UX Rough Edge Scan (STAB-03/04/05):**

After fixing test failures, scan the 3 main UX surfaces for additional rough edges BEYOND what the tests revealed:

a. **Wizards (STAB-03):** Open each wizard (onboarding, idea creation, idea-to-project, project creation). Check for: truncated text, broken step indicators, missing translations, non-functional buttons, layout overflow on narrow viewports. Test in both EN and DE.

b. **Mode Toggle (STAB-04):** Toggle between Simple and Expert mode. Check for: animation glitches, flash of wrong content, sections that should hide/show but don't, stale state after rapid toggling, mode label not updating.

c. **Navigation & Command Palette (STAB-05):** Navigate through all sidebar items and open the command palette (Cmd+K). Check for: active state highlighting, broken links/routes, palette items that don't execute, palette closing unexpectedly, nav items visible in wrong mode.

For each rough edge found:
- If fixable in <5 minutes: fix it immediately
- If larger: document it in 21-VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md under a new "UX Rough Edges" section with description and recommended fix

This scan ensures we "identify and polish" UX rough edges per STAB-03/04/05, not just fix test failures.

  <verify>
1. `cd /Users/developer/eluma && npx tsc --noEmit -p client/tsconfig.json` -- zero errors
2. Each failure has a documented fix in the verification results
3. No unrelated files were modified
  </verify>
  <done>
All identified failures have code fixes implemented. UX rough edge scan completed for wizards, mode toggle, and navigation/palette -- quick fixes applied, larger issues documented. TypeScript compiles cleanly. Verification results document updated with fix descriptions and UX rough edge findings.

  <name>Task 2: Human re-verifies fixed tests</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/21-stabilization/21-VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md</files>
  <action>
CHECKPOINT: Human re-runs previously failing tests to confirm fixes work.

What was built: Code fixes for all test failures identified in Plan 21-02. Each fix targets the specific behavior that was failing.

How to verify -- re-run ONLY the tests that previously failed:
1. Restart the dev server: `cd /Users/developer/eluma && npm run dev`
2. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
3. For each previously failing test, repeat the test steps from 21-VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md
4. Verify the fix resolves the original failure
5. Spot-check 2-3 previously passing tests to confirm no regressions

Report format:
RE-VERIFY 13-4: PASS (reconnection now works)
RE-VERIFY 16-3: PASS (Cmd+K palette opens correctly)
REGRESSION CHECK: Phase 15 tests still pass

Resume signal: Paste re-verification results. Type "all fixed" if everything now passes, or list any remaining failures.
  </action>
  <verify>Human has reported re-verification results for all previously failing tests, plus spot-checked regressions.</verify>
  <done>All previously failing tests now pass on re-verification, and no regressions detected in spot checks.</done>

  <files>
    .planning/phases/21-stabilization/21-VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md
    .planning/STATE.md
  </files>
  <action>
Based on the human's re-verification results:

1. Update 21-VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md:
   - Change previously FAIL results to PASS (if confirmed fixed) or note "Still failing" with details
   - Add a "Re-Verification" section at the bottom documenting the fix-verify cycle
   - Update the Summary totals

2. Update `.planning/STATE.md`:
   - Change "Current Position" to: Phase 21 of 21 (Stabilization) -- complete
   - Update status to reflect Phase 21 completion
   - Update progress to 100% (v1.3: 4/4 phases)
   - Remove "23 human verification tests pending from v1.2" from Blockers
   - Update "Next step" to: v1.3 milestone complete -- ready for milestone audit

3. If any tests are STILL failing after the fix cycle, document them as known issues in STATE.md Blockers section with a note that they need another fix cycle.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. 21-VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md has re-verification results recorded
2. Summary totals are updated and accurate
3. STATE.md reflects Phase 21 completion (or remaining issues if any)
  </verify>
  <done>
Verification results are finalized. STATE.md updated to reflect Phase 21 status. If all tests pass: milestone v1.3 is ready for audit. If some tests still fail: remaining failures are documented as blockers for a follow-up cycle.
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
1. All previously failing tests now pass (or are documented as known remaining issues)

4. STATE.md accurately reflects project status
5. 21-VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md is a complete audit trail of test -> fail -> fix -> re-verify
</verification>

- Verification results document is a complete record of the stabilization effort including UX rough edge findings

<objective>
Close verification gaps for WIZ-03 (idea-to-project wizard), GATE-01 (client-side graduation blocking), and GATE-04 (quality gate progress indicator). Build the question-per-screen wizard, quality gate indicator, and wire graduation flow to require wizard completion.

Purpose: This is the core quality gate enforcement on the client side. Users must answer all 6 mandatory GSD questions one-by-one before an idea can graduate to a project. The progress indicator shows clear feedback on what's answered and what remains. Server-side enforcement already exists from Plan 01 -- this plan adds the client-side UX layer.

Output: IdeaToProjectWizard with StepQuestion + StepProjectReady, QualityGateIndicator component, useQualityGate hook, updated IdeaGraduation with wizard integration, wizard.gsd.* i18n keys in DE and EN.

    **1. Create client/src/hooks/useQualityGate.ts:**

    A hook that provides the mandatory GSD questions and tracks answers locally:

    ```typescript
    import { useState, useMemo, useCallback } from "react";
    import type { GsdMandatoryQuestion } from "shared/types/wizard.js";

    // Import the question definitions. Since server/src/workflow/gsd-questions.ts
    // is server-only, we need the client to know the questions too.
    // Approach: Define a client-accessible copy or import from shared.
    // Check if gsd-questions.ts can be imported client-side.
    // If not (server-only imports like event store), hardcode the 6 question IDs
    // and fetch full definitions via a lightweight endpoint.
    //
    // PRAGMATIC APPROACH: Since the questions are a fixed, small set defined in
    // server/src/workflow/gsd-questions.ts, duplicate the question ID list on the
    // client. The server remains source of truth for validation.
    // Alternatively, create a GET /api/workflow/gsd-questions endpoint that returns
    // the question definitions. This is cleaner.
    //
    // RECOMMENDED: Create a simple GET endpoint or use the question definitions
    // already available from the shared types. If the executor finds that
    // gsd-questions.ts has server-only imports, use the endpoint approach.
    // If gsd-questions.ts only uses shared types and has no server imports,
    // it can be imported directly.

    interface UseQualityGateOptions {
      initialAnswers?: Record<string, string>;
    }

    interface UseQualityGateReturn {
      questions: GsdMandatoryQuestion[];
      answers: Record<string, string>;
      setAnswer: (questionId: string, value: string) => void;
      setAllAnswers: (answers: Record<string, string>) => void;
      answeredCount: number;
      totalRequired: number;
      allAnswered: boolean;
      loading: boolean;
    }

    export function useQualityGate(options?: UseQualityGateOptions): UseQualityGateReturn {
      // ... implementation
    }
    ```

    Implementation details:
    - `useState<GsdMandatoryQuestion[]>([])` for questions, fetched from server or imported
    - `useState<Record<string, string>>(options?.initialAnswers ?? {})` for answers
    - `useEffect` to fetch questions on mount:
      - Try importing from `server/src/workflow/gsd-questions.ts` if possible (check for server-only deps)
      - If not possible, fetch from `GET /api/workflow/gsd-questions` -- this endpoint should return the MANDATORY_GSD_QUESTIONS array. If this endpoint does not exist, the executor should add it as a simple route returning `getMandatoryGsdQuestions()`. Add the route to `server/src/routes/workflow.ts` or the nearest existing workflow route file (check for `server/src/routes/workflow.ts`).
      - Fallback: hardcode the 6 question IDs client-side with their titleKey/descriptionKey/type and options. This is pragmatic for 6 fixed questions.
    - `setAnswer(questionId, value)`: merges one answer into state
    - `setAllAnswers(answers)`: replaces all answers
    - Computed: `answeredCount`, `totalRequired`, `allAnswered` via useMemo
    - `loading`: true while questions are being fetched, false after

    **2. Create client/src/components/QualityGateIndicator.tsx (GATE-04):**

    A visual progress indicator showing how many mandatory questions are answered:

    ```typescript
    interface QualityGateIndicatorProps {
      answeredCount: number;
      totalRequired: number;
    }
    ```

    - Use `useLanguage` hook for `t()`
    - Render:
      - A horizontal progress bar: total width 100%, filled portion = `(answeredCount / totalRequired) * 100`%
        - Bar container: height 8px, backgroundColor #e5e7eb, borderRadius 4px, overflow hidden
        - Bar fill: height 100%, backgroundColor (green #22c55e when all answered, blue #2563eb otherwise), transition width 0.3s ease
      - Text below bar: `t("wizard.gate.progress", { answered: String(answeredCount), total: String(totalRequired) })` -- "X of Y questions answered"
      - If NOT all answered: additional text in amber/warning color (#d97706): `t("wizard.gate.blocked")`
      - If ALL answered: text in green (#16a34a): `t("wizard.gate.ready")`
    - Style: marginBottom 1.5rem, text fontSize 0.85rem
    - This is a presentational component -- it receives data, does not fetch. Parent uses useQualityGate hook.

    **3. Create StepQuestion.tsx** in `client/src/components/wizards/IdeaToProjectWizard/`:

    Renders a single GSD question with type-appropriate input and progress:

    ```typescript
    interface StepQuestionProps {
      question: GsdMandatoryQuestion;
      currentIndex: number;      // 0-based
      totalQuestions: number;
      answeredCount: number;      // total answered across all questions (for QualityGateIndicator)
      existingAnswer?: string;
      onAnswer: (answer: string) => void;
      onBack?: () => void;
    }
    ```

    Note: This component does NOT extend WizardStepProps -- it's used by IdeaToProjectWizard directly (not via WizardShell) because each step needs custom question props.

    Implementation:
    - Use `useLanguage` for `t()`
    - Use `useMode` for `isExpert` check
    - **Progress header:**
      - QualityGateIndicator with answeredCount and totalQuestions
      - "Question X of Y" text: `t("wizard.gsd.question_of", { current: String(currentIndex + 1), total: String(totalQuestions) })`
    - **Question content:**
      - Title: `t(question.titleKey)` as `<h3>` (shown in both modes)
      - Description: `t(question.descriptionKey)` as `<p>` -- show in Expert mode only (`isExpert && <p>...`)
    - **Input area based on question.type:**
      - `type === "text"`: `<textarea>` with minHeight 120px. Pre-fill with `existingAnswer` if provided. Track local value with useState. Validate against `question.validation?.minLength` before enabling Next.
      - `type === "choice"`: Vertical stack of option buttons. Each shows `t(option.labelKey)`. Clicking an option sets it as selected (useState). Selected button gets blue background (#2563eb, white text); others get light gray. For choice questions, user must explicitly click Next after selecting (do NOT auto-advance to give user time to consider).
    - **Navigation footer:**
      - "Back" button (if `onBack` provided): secondary style (gray border, dark text)
      - "Next" button: primary style (blue bg, white text). Disabled until answer is provided (text has minLength chars, choice has selection). On click calls `onAnswer(value)`.
    - Style: card-like container with padding, question title as 1.15rem #1f2937 bold, description as 0.9rem #6b7280

    **4. Create StepProjectReady.tsx:**

    Final wizard step showing all answers and "Create Project" confirmation:

    ```typescript
    interface StepProjectReadyProps {
      answers: Record<string, string>;
      questions: GsdMandatoryQuestion[];
      ideaTitle: string;
      onConfirm: () => void;
      onBack: () => void;
    }
    ```

    Implementation:
    - Use `useLanguage` for `t()`
    - Title: `t("wizard.gsd.project_ready")` -- "Your project is ready to be created!"
    - QualityGateIndicator showing 100% (answeredCount === totalRequired)
    - Answer summary section (`t("wizard.gsd.answer_summary")` -- "Your Answers"):
      - For each question: show `t(question.titleKey)` as label and the answer value (truncated to 100 chars if long)
      - Style: list with alternating light/white background rows, label bold, answer in normal weight
    - Idea name display: show the ideaTitle as context ("Creating project from: {ideaTitle}")
    - Buttons:
      - "Back" secondary button: calls `onBack()`
      - "Create Project" primary button: calls `onConfirm()`. Use `t("wizard.gsd.create_project")`.

    **5. Create IdeaToProjectWizard.tsx:**

    The main wizard that orchestrates the question-per-screen flow. Does NOT use WizardShell because each step needs different props (question, currentIndex, etc.). Instead, manages its own step navigation (same pattern, custom rendering).

    ```typescript
    interface IdeaToProjectWizardProps {
      ideaId: string;
      ideaTitle: string;
      onDone: (gsdAnswers: Record<string, string>) => void;
      onCancel?: () => void;
    }
    ```

    Implementation:
    - Import `useQualityGate` hook for questions and answer tracking
    - Import `WizardStepIndicator` for progress dots (reuse from Plan 01)
    - Import `QualityGateIndicator`, `StepQuestion`, `StepProjectReady`

    - `const { questions, answers, setAnswer, answeredCount, totalRequired, allAnswered, loading } = useQualityGate();`
    - `useState(0)` for `currentStep` (0 = first question, questions.length = StepProjectReady)
    - Total steps = questions.length + 1 (6 questions + 1 confirmation)

    - Build step indicator labels:
      ```typescript
      const stepLabels = [
        ...questions.map((q, i) => ({ id: q.id, labelKey: `wizard.gsd.q${i + 1}` })),
        { id: "ready", labelKey: "wizard.gsd.step_ready" },
      ];
      ```
      Since having 7 steps in the indicator may be too wide, use a simplified approach: show WizardStepIndicator with just the step dots (small circles without labels) OR show QualityGateIndicator as the primary progress indicator and skip WizardStepIndicator entirely. The QualityGateIndicator already shows "X of Y" progress.

      RECOMMENDED: Skip WizardStepIndicator for this wizard (7 steps with labels would be cramped). Use QualityGateIndicator as the main progress indicator instead. This is cleaner and more appropriate for a longer wizard.

    - Rendering logic:
      ```tsx
      if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

      if (currentStep < questions.length) {
        // Question step
        const question = questions[currentStep];
        return (
          <div style={styles.container}>
            <div style={styles.card}>
              {titleKey && <h2>{t("wizard.gsd.title")}</h2>}
              <StepQuestion
                question={question}
                currentIndex={currentStep}
                totalQuestions={questions.length}
                answeredCount={answeredCount}
                existingAnswer={answers[question.id]}
                onAnswer={(value) => {
                  setAnswer(question.id, value);
                  setCurrentStep((s) => s + 1);
                }}
                onBack={currentStep > 0 ? () => setCurrentStep((s) => s - 1) : undefined}
              />
              {onCancel && <CancelButton />}
            </div>
          </div>
        );
      } else {
        // Project ready step
        return (
          <div style={styles.container}>
            <div style={styles.card}>
              <StepProjectReady
                answers={answers}
                questions={questions}
                ideaTitle={ideaTitle}
                onConfirm={() => onDone(answers)}
                onBack={() => setCurrentStep(questions.length - 1)}
              />
              {onCancel && <CancelButton />}
            </div>
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```

    - Use the same container/card styles as WizardShell (white bg, rounded, shadow, centered, max-width 600px) for visual consistency.
    - Cancel button at bottom of card, same style as WizardShell cancel.

    **6. Add i18n keys** to both en.json and de.json under `wizard.gsd`:

    **EN:**
    ```json
    "gsd": {
      "title": "Define Your Project",
      "intro_title": "Let's define your project",
      "intro_desc": "Answer these questions to turn your idea into a well-defined project.",
      "question_of": "Question {{current}} of {{total}}",
      "project_ready": "Your project is ready to be created!",
      "create_project": "Create Project",
      "answer_summary": "Your Answers",
      "creating_from": "Creating project from: {{title}}",
      "step_ready": "Ready",
      "required_before_graduation": "Answer all project definition questions before proposing graduation",
      "start_questions": "Answer Questions",
      "questions_complete": "Questions completed",
      "edit_answers": "Edit Answers"
    }
    ```

    **DE:**
    ```json
    "gsd": {
      "title": "Dein Projekt definieren",
      "intro_title": "Lass uns dein Projekt definieren",
      "intro_desc": "Beantworte diese Fragen, um deine Idee in ein klar definiertes Projekt umzuwandeln.",
      "question_of": "Frage {{current}} von {{total}}",
      "project_ready": "Dein Projekt kann jetzt erstellt werden!",
      "create_project": "Projekt erstellen",
      "answer_summary": "Deine Antworten",
      "creating_from": "Projekt erstellen aus: {{title}}",
      "step_ready": "Bereit",
      "required_before_graduation": "Beantworte alle Projektdefinitionsfragen, bevor du die Graduierung vorschlägst",
      "start_questions": "Fragen beantworten",
      "questions_complete": "Fragen abgeschlossen",
      "edit_answers": "Antworten bearbeiten"
    }
    ```

    Also add `wizard.gate.ready` key if not already present from Plan 01:
    - EN: `"ready": "All questions answered -- ready to create project"`
    - DE: `"ready": "Alle Fragen beantwortet -- Projekt kann erstellt werden"`

    Place `gsd` inside the existing `wizard` object alongside `cancel`, `back`, `next`, `finish`, `step_of`, `gate`, `project`, and (from Plan 04) `onboarding` and `idea` keys.

    client/src/i18n/locales/de.json

  <action>
    **1. Update client/src/components/IdeaGraduation.tsx:**

    The existing IdeaGraduation component handles the propose -> vote -> graduate flow. Modify it to require completing the IdeaToProjectWizard before graduation can proceed.

    **Add imports:**
    ```typescript
    import { IdeaToProjectWizard } from "./wizards/IdeaToProjectWizard/IdeaToProjectWizard.js";
    import { QualityGateIndicator } from "./QualityGateIndicator.js";
    import { useLanguage } from "../hooks/useLanguage.js";
    ```

    **Add state:**
    ```typescript
    const [showGsdWizard, setShowGsdWizard] = useState(false);
    const [gsdAnswers, setGsdAnswers] = useState<Record<string, string>>({});
    const { t } = useLanguage();
    const wizardCompleted = Object.keys(gsdAnswers).length >= 6; // 6 mandatory questions
    ```

    **Modify the "Propose Graduation" button behavior:**

    Currently, when the idea status is "ready" and user clicks the propose button, it calls `handlePropose()` directly. Change this:

    - If `wizardCompleted` is false (wizard not done yet):
      - Replace the propose button with "Answer Questions" button: `t("wizard.gsd.start_questions")`
      - Clicking it sets `showGsdWizard = true`
      - Show QualityGateIndicator below the button showing current progress (0 of 6 initially)
      - Show explanation text: `t("wizard.gsd.required_before_graduation")`

    - If `wizardCompleted` is true (wizard done):
      - Show the original "Propose Graduation" button (existing behavior)
      - Show QualityGateIndicator with 6/6 (green, all answered)
      - Show "Edit Answers" link: `t("wizard.gsd.edit_answers")` -- clicking reopens the wizard with existing answers pre-filled

    **Render the wizard overlay:**
    ```tsx
    if (showGsdWizard) {
      return (
        <IdeaToProjectWizard
          ideaId={idea.id}
          ideaTitle={idea.rawInput?.substring(0, 80) || idea.id}
          onDone={(answers) => {
            setGsdAnswers(answers);
            setShowGsdWizard(false);
          }}
          onCancel={() => setShowGsdWizard(false)}
        />
      );
    }
    ```

    Place this early return at the top of the component's return, BEFORE the existing graduation UI.

    **Pass gsdAnswers to graduation API:**

    When `handlePropose` is called (after wizard is completed), the graduation proposal needs to eventually include gsdAnswers. The current flow is:
    1. User proposes graduation -> `onPropose(ideaId)` is called
    2. Team votes -> `onVote(ideaId, approve)` is called
    3. When votes are unanimous, server auto-graduates

    The gsdAnswers need to reach the server during graduation. Two approaches:

    **Approach A (simpler, recommended):** Modify the `onPropose` callback to accept gsdAnswers:
    - Update the `onPropose` prop type to `(ideaId: string, gsdAnswers?: Record<string, string>) => Promise<IdeaState | null>`
    - When calling `onPropose`, pass gsdAnswers: `await onPropose(idea.id, gsdAnswers)`
    - The parent (IdeaPool.tsx) passes this to `useIdeaPool.proposeGraduation` which sends to the server
    - The server's graduation route already accepts gsdAnswers in the body (from Plan 01)

    **If modifying onPropose is too invasive:** Store gsdAnswers as a hidden field and include them when the vote triggers auto-graduation. The server graduation route (POST /:id/graduate) already validates gsdAnswers, so the answers just need to arrive at the right time.

    **Practical minimum:** At minimum, update IdeaGraduation to block the propose button until the wizard is completed, and include gsdAnswers in the propose/graduation call so the server can validate. The exact prop threading depends on the useIdeaPool hook's `proposeGraduation` signature -- check and adapt.

    **2. GATE-03 enforcement check:**

    Verify that the wizard logic does NOT check `useMode().isExpert` for bypass. The wizard shows in BOTH modes. The only mode-aware behavior is: Expert mode shows question descriptions in StepQuestion; Simple mode hides them. The gate itself is identical.

    **3. No additional i18n keys needed** -- all graduation-related wizard keys are already defined in Task 1's `wizard.gsd.*` namespace (required_before_graduation, start_questions, questions_complete, edit_answers).

    IdeaGraduation requires completing the IdeaToProjectWizard before graduation can be proposed. When wizard is not completed, "Answer Questions" button launches the wizard; QualityGateIndicator shows 0/6 progress; explanation text explains the requirement. After wizard completion, normal graduation flow proceeds with gsdAnswers passed to server. Quality gate enforced identically in Simple and Expert mode (GATE-03). Client-side blocking UI satisfies GATE-01. All text i18n'd.
